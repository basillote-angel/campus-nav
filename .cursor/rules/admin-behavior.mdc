## 📋 Daily Workflows

### **1. Reviewing Claims** (HIGHEST PRIORITY)

**What to do:**
- ✅ Check `/admin/claims` daily for pending claims
- ✅ **Approve** when ownership is verified:
  - Ownership evidence provided
  - Claim details match item description
  - Item is still available
  - **User receives notification automatically**
- ✅ **Reject** with clear reason when:
  - Ownership cannot be verified
  - Claim details don't match
  - Item already claimed
  - **Always provide specific rejection reason**
  - **User receives notification with reason automatically**

**Best Practices:**
- ⏰ Review claims within 24 hours
- 📝 Be specific in rejection reasons (e.g., "Unable to verify ownership - please provide additional proof")
- ✅ Approve promptly when ownership is clear
- 🔄 Update item status after approval

---

### **2. Managing Items** (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

**What to do:**
- ✅ Post found items directly with complete information
- ✅ Edit incorrect information, typos, or wrong categories
- ✅ Delete only if: spam, duplicate, successfully returned, or no longer relevant
- ✅ Update status promptly (unclaimed → claimed → closed)

**Best Practices:**
- ✅ Verify information before posting found items
- 📸 Upload clear images when available
- 📍 Be specific with location descriptions
- ⏰ Mark items as claimed after return

---

### **3. Reviewing AI Matches** (ONGOING)

**What to do:**
- ✅ Review suggested matches in `/admin/matches`
- ✅ Understand match scores:
  - **80%+**: Very likely match - approve and notify
  - **60-80%**: Possible match - review carefully
  - **<60%**: Unlikely match - dismiss
- ✅ Verify matches manually before relying on AI alone

**Best Practices:**
- 🔍 Review high-score matches first (most accurate)
- 📊 Use match score as guide, not absolute truth
- 🔄 Check item details before approving matches
- ⚠️ Don't dismiss valid matches - users depend on notifications

---

### **4. Managing Users** (AS NEEDED)

**What to do:**
- ✅ View all users, check roles, monitor activity
- ✅ Edit user information when needed
- ✅ Create staff/admin accounts manually
- ⚠️ Delete only if: inactive/spam, user requests, or violates terms

**Best Practices:**
- 🔒 Protect user privacy - never share user data
- 👥 Respect user roles - only admins can manage roles
- ⚠️ Be cautious when deleting - consider impact on items/claims
- 📧 Verify identity before changing user information
