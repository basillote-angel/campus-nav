## 📋 Daily Admin Workflows

### **1. Reviewing Claims** 🔴 **HIGH PRIORITY**

**Location:** `/admin/claims`

**What to Do:**
1. **Check Pending Claims Daily**
   - Review all found items with status `matched` (pending approval)
   - Read the claim message carefully
   - Verify item details match the claim

2. **Approve Claims:**
   - ✅ Verify ownership evidence is provided
   - ✅ Match claim details with item description
   - ✅ Check if item is still available
   - ✅ Click "Approve" button
   - ✅ **Item status automatically changes to `returned`**
   - ✅ **User will receive notification automatically**

3. **Reject Claims:**
   - ❌ If ownership cannot be verified
   - ❌ If claim details don't match
   - ❌ If item is already claimed
   - ⚠️ **ALWAYS provide a clear rejection reason**
   - ✅ Click "Reject" and enter reason
   - ✅ **Item status automatically reverts to `unclaimed`**
   - ✅ **User will receive notification with reason automatically**

**Best Practices:**
- ⏰ **Review claims within 24 hours** for better user experience
- 📝 **Be specific** in rejection reasons (e.g., "Unable to verify ownership - please provide additional proof")
- ✅ **Approve promptly** when ownership is clear
- 🔄 **Keep items updated** - status automatically changes to `returned` after approval

### **2. Managing Items (Lost/Found Posts)** 🟡 **MEDIUM PRIORITY**

**Location:** `/item`

**What to Do:**
1. **Review New Items:**
   - Check items posted by users
   - Verify information is complete and accurate
   - Ensure appropriate category is selected

2. **Post Found Items:**
   - Admin can post found items directly
   - Fill in all required fields:
     - Title
     - Category
     - Description
     - Location
     - Date Found
     - Image (if available)
   - Set status to `unclaimed` for found items

3. **Edit Items:**
   - Update incorrect information
   - Fix typos or errors
   - Change category if needed
   - Update status when appropriate

4. **Delete Items:**
   - Only delete if:
     - Item is spam/inappropriate
     - Item is duplicate
     - Item has been successfully returned
     - Item is no longer relevant (very old)

**Best Practices:**
- ✅ **Verify information** before posting found items
- 📸 **Upload clear images** when available
- 📍 **Be specific** with location descriptions
- ⏰ **Mark items as returned** (status `returned`) after they're returned
- 🔄 **Update status** regularly

---

### **3. Reviewing AI Matches** 🟢 **ONGOING**

**Location:** `/admin/matches`

**What to Do:**
1. **Review Suggested Matches:**
   - AI automatically matches Lost items with Found items
   - View match scores (higher = better match)
   - Check threshold: matches below 60% may not be relevant

2. **Verify Matches:**
   - ✅ **High Score (80%+)**: Very likely match - notify users
   - ✅ **Medium Score (60-80%)**: Possible match - review details
   - ❌ **Low Score (<60%)**: Unlikely match - dismiss

3. **Action on Matches:**
   - If match looks correct:
     - Both users are automatically notified
     - Match is marked as `pending`
   - If match is incorrect:
     - Dismiss the match
     - System will not suggest it again

**Best Practices:**
- 🔍 **Review high-score matches first** (most likely to be correct)
- 📊 **Use match score** as a guide, not absolute truth
- 🔄 **Check item details** before relying on AI alone
- ⚠️ **Don't dismiss valid matches** - users depend on notifications

---

### **4. Managing Users** 🔵 **AS NEEDED** ⚠️ **ADMIN ONLY**

**Location:** `/users`  
**Access:** Admin role only (not available to staff)

**What to Do:**
1. **View Users:**
   - See all registered users
   - Check user roles (Admin, Staff, Student)
   - View user activity
   - Filter by role (defaults to admin)

2. **Edit Users:**
   - Update user information
   - Change user roles (Admin/Staff/Student)
   - Update email or name if needed

3. **Delete Users:**
   - ⚠️ **Only delete if:**
     - Account is inactive/spam
     - User requests deletion
     - Account violates terms of service
   - ⚠️ **Consider consequences:** Deleting user deletes their items/posts

4. **Create Users:**
   - Create admin accounts manually (defaults to admin role)
   - Set appropriate roles
   - Send login credentials securely

**Best Practices:**
- 🔒 **Protect user privacy** - don't share user data
- 👥 **Respect user roles** - only admins can manage users
- ⚠️ **Be cautious when deleting** - consider impact on items/claims
- 📧 **Verify identity** before changing user information

---

### **5. Managing Categories** 🟣 **OCCASIONAL**

**Location:** `/categories`

**What to Do:**
1. **Create Categories:**
   - Add new categories for items (e.g., "Electronics", "Clothing", "Books")
   - Ensure category name is clear and specific
   - Avoid duplicates

2. **Edit Categories:**
   - Fix typos
   - Update category names
   - Make descriptions clearer

3. **Delete Categories:**
   - ⚠️ **Only if category is unused**
   - ⚠️ **Check for items using category first**
   - Consider merging similar categories instead

**Best Practices:**
- 📋 **Keep categories organized** and specific
- 🔄 **Avoid frequent changes** - confuses users
- 📊 **Use analytics** to see which categories are popular
- ✅ **Test categories** before deploying

---

## 🎯 Admin Best Practices

### **Communication & Notifications**

1. **Response Times:**
   - ⏰ **Claims:** Review within 24 hours
   - ⏰ **User Reports:** Respond within 48 hours
   - ⏰ **Urgent Items:** Same day response

2. **Notification Messages:**
   - ✅ **Be clear and professional**
   - ✅ **Provide specific information**
   - ✅ **Use appropriate tone**
   - ❌ **Don't use jargon** - keep it simple
   - ❌ **Don't be vague** - be specific

3. **Rejection Reasons:**
   - ✅ **Explain why** claim was rejected
   - ✅ **Suggest next steps** (e.g., "Please provide additional proof")
   - ✅ **Be helpful** - guide users on how to fix issues
   - ❌ **Don't be harsh** - users are already disappointed

### **Data Management**

1. **Item Status Management:**
   
   **Lost Items:**
   - `open` → Lost item, still looking for it
   - `matched` → Item has been matched with a found item
   - `closed` → Item no longer relevant (found elsewhere or no longer needed)
   
   **Found Items:**
   - `unclaimed` → Found item, waiting for owner to claim
   - `matched` → Item has been claimed by a user (pending admin approval)
   - `returned` → Claim approved by admin, item returned to owner

2. **Status Updates:**
   - ✅ **Update promptly** when status changes
   - ✅ **Keep items current** - don't leave old items active
   - ✅ **Mark as returned** (`returned` status) after claim approval
   - 🔄 **Archive old items** after 90+ days

3. **Data Accuracy:**
   - ✅ **Verify information** before posting/editing
   - ✅ **Check for duplicates** before adding items
   - ✅ **Keep descriptions accurate** and updated
   - 📸 **Use quality images** when available

---

### **Security & Privacy**

1. **User Data:**
   - 🔒 **Protect user information** - never share emails/phone numbers
   - 🔒 **Respect privacy** - only access what's necessary
   - 🔒 **Secure passwords** - use strong passwords for admin accounts
   - 🔒 **Log out** when done - especially on shared computers

2. **System Access:**
   - 👥 **Only admins/staff** should have access
   - 🔐 **Use strong passwords** - minimum 8 characters, mixed case, numbers, symbols
   - 🔄 **Change passwords regularly** - every 90 days
   - ⚠️ **Don't share accounts** - each admin should have their own

3. **Claims & Ownership:**
   - ✅ **Verify ownership** before approving claims
   - ✅ **Require proof** if unsure
   - ❌ **Don't approve** suspicious claims
   - 📝 **Document reasons** for rejections

---

### **AI Match Management**

1. **Understanding Match Scores:**
   - **90-100%**: Excellent match - very likely correct
   - **80-90%**: Good match - likely correct
   - **70-80%**: Fair match - review carefully
   - **60-70%**: Possible match - verify details
   - **<60%**: Poor match - likely incorrect

2. **Review Process:**
   - ✅ **Review high scores first** - most accurate
   - ✅ **Check item details** - verify manually
   - ✅ **Notify users** for good matches
   - ❌ **Don't rely solely on AI** - use judgment
   - 🔄 **Provide feedback** - help improve AI

3. **Handling Matches:**
   - ✅ **Approve valid matches** - users are notified automatically
   - ✅ **Dismiss incorrect matches** - prevent false notifications
   - ✅ **Review regularly** - check match queue daily

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid

### **❌ Don't:**
1. **Approve claims without verification**
   - Always check ownership evidence
   - Verify claim details match item

2. **Delete items without checking**
   - Check if item is still relevant

3. **Reject claims without reason**
   - Always provide clear rejection reason
   - Help users understand what went wrong

4. **Ignore AI matches**
   - Review high-score matches regularly
   - Users depend on notifications

5. **Share admin credentials**
   - Each admin should have their own account
   - Use strong, unique passwords

6. **Leave items unupdated**
   - Status automatically changes to `returned` after claim approval
   - Update status promptly for other changes

7. **Be vague in communications**
   - Provide specific information
   - Be helpful and clear
